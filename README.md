dockprom
========

A monitoring solution for Docker hosts and containers with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor),
[NodeExporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) and alerting with [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).


## Install

Clone this repository on your Docker host, cd into dockprom directory and run compose up:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@git.smava.de:7999/~asingh/dockprom.git
cd dockprom

ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin ./deploy.sh
```

Prerequisites:

* Docker Engine >= 18.05.0-ce
* Docker Compose >= 1.21.2

Containers:

* Prometheus (metrics database) `http://<host-ip>:9090`
* AlertManager (alerts management) `http://<host-ip>:9093`
* Grafana (visualize metrics) `http://<host-ip>:3000`
* NodeExporter (host metrics collector)
* cAdvisor (containers metrics collector)
* Scriptexporter (Custom scripts - EUREKA metrics)
* Blackbox Exporter (main services metrics)
* Caddy (reverse proxy and basic auth provider for prometheus and alertmanager)

## Setup Grafana

Navigate to `http://<host-ip>:3000` and login with user ***admin*** password ***admin***. You can change the credentials in the compose file or by supplying the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables on compose up.

Grafana is preconfigured with dashboards and Prometheus as the default data source:

* Name: Prometheus
* Type: Prometheus
* Url: http://prometheus:9090
* Access: proxy

***Docker Host Dashboard***

![Host](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Docker_Host.png)

The Docker Host Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the resource usage of your server:

* Server uptime, CPU idle percent, number of CPU cores, available memory, swap and storage
* System load average graph, running and blocked by IO processes graph, interrupts graph
* CPU usage graph by mode (guest, idle, iowait, irq, nice, softirq, steal, system, user)
* Memory usage graph by distribution (used, free, buffers, cached)
* IO usage graph (read Bps, read Bps and IO time)
* Network usage graph by device (inbound Bps, Outbound Bps)
* Swap usage and activity graphs

For storage and particularly Free Storage graph, you have to specify the fstype in grafana graph request.
You can find it in `grafana/dashboards/docker_host.json`, at line 480 :

      "expr": "sum(node_filesystem_free{fstype=\"btrfs\"})",

I work on BTRFS, so i need to change `aufs` to `btrfs`.

You can find right value for your system in Prometheus `http://<host-ip>:9090` launching this request :

      node_filesystem_free

***Docker Containers Dashboard***

![Containers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Docker_Containers.png)

The Docker Containers Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring running containers:

* Total containers CPU load, memory and storage usage
* Running containers graph, system load graph, IO usage graph
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Container cached memory usage graph
* Container network inbound usage graph
* Container network outbound usage graph

Note that this dashboard doesn't show the containers that are part of the monitoring stack.

***Monitor Services Dashboard***

![Monitor Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Prometheus.png)

The Monitor Services Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the containers that make up the monitoring stack:

* Prometheus container uptime, monitoring stack total memory usage, Prometheus local storage memory chunks and series
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Prometheus chunks to persist and persistence urgency graphs
* Prometheus chunks ops and checkpoint duration graphs
* Prometheus samples ingested rate, target scrapes and scrape duration graphs
* Prometheus HTTP requests graph
* Prometheus alerts graph

I've set the Prometheus retention period to 200h and the heap size to 1GB, you can change these values in the compose file.

```yaml
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    command:
      - '-storage.local.target-heap-size=1073741824'
      - '-storage.local.retention=200h'
```

Make sure you set the heap size to a maximum of 50% of the total physical memory.
